	<h3 style="color: #42a600">	&emsp; As we progress through this journey, I feel as a certified individual who is currently engaged in cybersecurity AND YOU as an individual who is
	interested in learning cybersecurity (we must assume that you are one if you are here), we should start with a warning from this website, which is scripted using HTML, CSS, and 
	JavaScripting. YOU are giving up information every day, and while it may, or may NOT, be in your best interest, you are giving it up. Understanding these concepts can change you
	from a student into a Cybersecurity ninja! In fact, you’ve giving me a certain amount of information by accepting and using this website.
	
	<br>
	<br>

	Some of YOUR personal data includes: 

	<br>
	<br>
	
	<p style="color: #42a600"></p>
	<br>
	<p style="color: #42a600"></p>
	<br>
	<p style="color: #42a600"></p>
	<br>
	<p style="color: #42a600"></p>
   	<br>
	<br>

	&emsp; So, why would we make a note of this? Why would we have this discussion? First of all, because the author of this site wants you to be aware of the dangers that you 
	progress through the Internet as you use it, AND to illustrate a lesson on the whole of the risk that is involved with Cybersecurity. Consider it as a lesson in “Web Security.” 
	Web Security is defined as a range of security tactics which are utilized for protecting activities across the Internet domain <a href=" https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/cybersecurity/what-is-internet-security.html ">(McAfee, 2021).</a>
	 There is a significant amount of risk AND reward associated with utilizing the Internet and just as I have ascertained some of your information now, we can find other pieces of information such as what browser,
	whether the browser is on-line and what it is, which operating system in use, or even your location. Information such as your display screen height and Width, your screen depth, 
	and resolution are all also things that the browser can access <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Web-Warrior-Sasha-Vodnik/dp/1305078446/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=JavaScript+Web+Warrior+Series&qid=1614551614&s=instant-video&sr=1-1">(Vodnik, 2011).</a>
	 More information can be found by purchasing <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Web-Warrior-Sasha-Vodnik/dp/1305078446/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=JavaScript+Web+Warrior+Series&qid=1614551614&s=instant-video&sr=1-1">the JavaScript Web Warrior series</a> for simple tutorials and understanding of how JavaScripting works or visit the programming link within in this page for more information. 
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp; THIS website is a safe place for you to learn and grow, so do not be concerned on whether your information is being tracked from here. It is not, and the author would 
	never do this. Just be aware, as you start this journey, of this first lesson on your on-line security. Now, if some of this information did not give YOUR exact location, then you can be SLIGHTLY proud of yourself, since that means your browser is 
	protecting you. HOWEVER, This is only a start for the information that can be descerned from you.
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp; As always, the author has provided further information and links for 
	additional reading. For more information, please feel free to peruse and brief yourself on the information contained with the <a href=" https://owasp.org/">The Open Web Application Security Project ®.</a> This page is a community dedicated to creating 
	and handling issues. This page is one of the author’s favorite examples of places that it is possible to go for information concerning projects, chapters, and involvement within the Cybersecurity community. Another great source specifically for HTML programming
	is the use of <a href=" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security ">Web Security for Developers,</a> a site that specifically addresses articles dealing with writing webpages and how they can be coded in a more secure manner. Should this topic interest you,
	an extremely deep dive can be accomplished by diving into the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href=" https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-70r4.pdf ">Special Publication 800-70 </a> "National Checklist Program for IT
	Products – Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers. This special publication supersedes Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products: Guidance for Checklists Users and Developers, and encompasses a vast security knowledge base. This manual is also considered
	"authoritative" as the standard that other standards are written from.
